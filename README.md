# CoffeeRoasterV2

This project is a redesign of the coffee roaster controls that were implemented over a decade ago. In that previous design, the low level control circuits were installed within the coffee roaster itself. Years of operation in the elevated temperatures combined with dust from the roasting process have made maintenance of the circuits difficult at best, not to mention the tight fit of these circuits within the roaster.

For more information, check out the Documentation directory of this project.

Note that the Node Red software for this project resides in a separate GitHub repository (*CoffeeRoasterV2NodeRed*). This allows use of the Node Red Project feature to manage the Node Red code through Git/Github. The Git repository for that code resides on the Atomic Pi and so is separate from this repository.
